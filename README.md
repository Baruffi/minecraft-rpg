## Classes

At the start of the game each player may choose a primary class. That class with determine which items and skill trees will be available to them at the start. In the late game, the player has the option to multi-class.

## Skills

Skill points are rewarded for every in-game level obtained. They can be invested in a multitude of skill trees and are kept even through death. However, the player may not earn new skill points for reaching the same level as before.

Each skill on the skill tree has the following attributes:

- Type: Passive/Active
- Name: Invisibility, Fire Ball, Sword Slash...
- Level: 1, 2, 3...

## Items

As the player explores the world, they can find/craft special items with awesome effects that benefit their class and/or playstyle. They are organized into tier for different power levels, with higher tier items being more difficult to obtain.

These items will have the following notable attributes:

- Tier: 1, 2, 3...
- Class: Generic, Warrior Only, Mage Only...

## Quests

The plugin will also generate random quests for each player to complete. Completing a quest will earn them a nice reward, but they are all optional. Also, as the player levels up, quests will become more challenging, but offer better rewards as well.
